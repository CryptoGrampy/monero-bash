# [monero-bash systemd services]

The [[systemd] files created by [monero-bash]](https://github.com/hinto-janaiyo/monero-bash/blob/main/src/func/systemd.sh) are created dynamically at the moment of package installation (or when using `monero-bash reset <process> systemd`), based off the user's config file and system. The files here are just the reference for what a typical service should look like.
