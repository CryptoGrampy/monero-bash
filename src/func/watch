# watch functions - for watching output of the systemd services created
# by monero-bash, e.g. "monero-bash-xmrig.service"
#
# this function would be much simpler to implement if i could use "screen".
# although that program is GNU, it is not within the coreutils, and also not
# pre-installed on Arch, Debian, Fedora, etc.
#
# and so, this is a (poor man's) version using tools most Linux distros have
