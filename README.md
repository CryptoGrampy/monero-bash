## About
monero-bash is a wrapper/manager for:

* [`monerod`](https://github.com/monero-project/monero)
* [`monero-wallet-cli`](https://github.com/monero-project/monero)
* [`xmrig`](https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig)
* [`p2pool`](https://github.com/SChernykh/p2pool)

monero-bash automates these programs into interactive prompts and `linux-like` commands

***Installing `monero-bash` and mining on P2Pool in 40 seconds:***

## FAQ
<details>
<summary>Where does monero-bash download packages from?</summary>

---

[Click here for a quick explanation of how monero-bash upgrades packages](https://github.com/hinto-janaiyo/monero-bash/blob/main/docs/upgrade_explanation.md)

If you'd like to see detailed output when installing/upgrading, type:
```
monero-bash install/upgrade <package> verbose
```

* Monero - `https://downloads.getmonero.org/cli/linux64`
* monero-bash - `https://github.com/hinto-janaiyo/monero-bash`
* XMRig - `https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig`
* P2Pool - `https://github.com/SChernykh/p2pool`

The latest packages are downloaded through the GitHub API. If the API fails, monero-bash will attempt to find a download link by HTML filtering the package's `/releases/latest/` GitHub page.

Hashes for Monero are found here: `https://www.getmonero.org/downloads/hashes.txt`

Every other package hash is found on its respective GitHub page.

Unfortunately, there is no "official" central repo for all these programs, so `monero-bash` individually seeks out the links/hashes (makes my life very hard)

<summary>Does monero-bash have dependencies?</summary>

---

***monero-bash does not have any hard dependencies***

If you have a mainstream Linux distro (Ubuntu, Debian, Mint, Arch, Fedora, etc.), you already have everything needed for monero-bash to work:
* bash
* wget
* procfs
* systemd
* GNU coreutils
* GNU grep/awk/sed

</details>

<details>
<summary>monero-bash won't let me upgrade!</summary>

---

```
monero-bash upgrade <package> force
```
Will forcefully upgrade, even if up to date

OR

```
monero-bash remove <package> &&
monero-bash install <package>
```

---
</details>

<details>
<summary>What happens if I cancel/shutdown mid-upgrade?</summary>

---

monero-bash uses a temporary folder until it's ready to swap binaries:
```
/tmp/monero-bash.XXXXXXXXX
```

If you cancel ***right*** as the software is being upgraded, monero-bash will swap back your old binaries, and clean up temporary files.

If you cancel ***after*** software is installed, but before the local state is updated, monero-bash will force update it and clean up.

**There's nothing monero-bash can do to help if you shutdown your computer mid-upgrade**

---

</details>

<details>
<summary>What is the hash check before every upgrade?</summary>

---

monero-bash checks its own hash integrity before any manipulation of data. If any hash check fails, any command involving data manipulation will also fail.

If you've edited some files and now it won't work, remove monero-bash manually and install a fresh copy:
```
sudo rm -r /usr/local/share/monero-bash
sudo rm /usr/local/bin/monero-bash
sudo rm -r "$HOME/.monero-bash"
```
If you're manually editing the code and forcing it to work, please be careful. Shell scripts are one empty variable away from wiping your drive. Definitely not speaking from experience.

<details>
<summary>Where does monero-bash install itself?</summary>

---

The source folder gets installed in
```
/usr/local/share/monero-bash
```

The PATH is set with a symlink in
```
/usr/local/bin/monero-bash
```
The user folder is in
```
/home/user/.monero-bash
```

---
</details>

<details>
<summary>Where does monero-bash install packages?</summary>

---

```
/usr/local/share/monero-bash/bin/
```
is where packages live, with respective folder names

---
</details>

<details>
<summary>How to uninstall?</summary>

---
```
monero-bash uninstall
```
This will delete all `monero-bash` files AND `.monero-bash`

If your monero-bash is bugged and not uninstalling, you can manually remove everything like this:
```
sudo rm -r /usr/local/share/monero-bash
sudo rm /usr/local/bin/monero-bash
sudo rm -r "$HOME/.monero-bash"
```
To delete `systemd` files:
```
sudo rm /etc/systemd/system/monero-bash-monerod.service
sudo rm /etc/systemd/system/monero-bash-xmrig.service
sudo rm /etc/systemd/system/monero-bash-p2pool.service
```

Please be careful, remember to move your `/wallets/` before uninstalling!
