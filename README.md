# monero-bash
WIP wrapper for monero-cli written in bash

if you want to beta-test:
```
git clone https://github.com/hinto-janaiyo/monero-bash &&
cd monero-bash &&
./monero-bash
```
it will be added to path so after the initial configuration:
```
monero-bash
```
will work anywhere

for help:
```
monero-bash help
```
