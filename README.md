## About
monero-bash is a wrapper/manager for:

* `monerod`
* `monero-wallet-cli`
* `monero-rpc`
* `xmrig`
* `p2pool`

monero-bash abstracts/automates these programs into simple interactive prompts and `linux-like` commands

[This project is a CCS Proposal](https://repo.getmonero.org/monero-project/ccs-proposals/-/merge_requests/297)

If this program is useful to you, please show support to get it funded!

## Features
* üì¶ `PACKAGE MANAGER` automated downloading, verifying and upgrading of packages
* üíµ `WALLET` wallet menu to display names/amounts of wallets
* üë∫ `DAEMON` control `monerod` more easily/automatically
* ‚õèÔ∏è  `MINING` automated mining, **default is P2Pool**
* üëÅÔ∏è  `WATCH` switch between normal terminal and live output of `monerod`, `xmrig`, `p2pool`
* üìà `STATS` various stats to display (processes, price, disk usage, etc)

## Install

## FAQ
<details>
<summary>Is this a virus?</summary>

---

[No. Click here for a quick explanation of how monero-bash upgrades packages](https://github.com/hinto-janaiyo/monero-bash/blob/main/docs/upgrade_explanation.md)

</details>

<details>
<summary>Where does monero-bash download packages from?</summary>

---

* Monero - `https://downloads.getmonero.org/cli/linux64`
* monero-bash - `https://github.com/hinto-janaiyo/monero-bash`
* XMRig - `https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig`
* P2Pool - `https://github.com/SChernykh/p2pool`

The latest packages are always downloaded through the GitHub API. If the API fails for whatever reason, monero-bash will attempt to find a download link by HTML filtering the package's `/releases/latest/` GitHub page.

Hashes for Monero are found here: `https://www.getmonero.org/downloads/hashes.txt`

Every other package hash is found on its respective GitHub page.

Unfortunately, there is no "official" central repo for all these programs, so `monero-bash` individually seeks out the links/hashes (makes my life very hard)

<summary>Does monero-bash have dependencies?</summary>

---

***monero-bash does not have any hard dependencies***

If you have a mainstream Linux distro (Ubuntu, Debian, Mint, Arch, Fedora, etc.), you already have everything needed for monero-bash to work
* bash
* wget
* procfs
* systemd
* GNU coreutils
* GNU grep/awk/sed

<details>
<summary>monero-bash says I have a package but I don't and can't upgrade!</summary>

---

```
monero-bash upgrade <package> force
```
Will forcefully upgrade, even if up to date

OR

```
monero-bash remove <package> &&
monero-bash install <package>
```

---
</details>

<details>
<summary>What happens if I cancel/shutdown mid-upgrade?</summary>

---

monero-bash makes and uses a temporary folder until it's ready to swap your current binaries with the new.

Canceling, exiting the terminal, or shutting down your computer is still not recommended while upgrading as you could cancel the actual swapping of software, which would leave you with corrupted binaries and local state file.

This is especially true when upgrading `monero-bash`, itself. Thankfully, `monero-bash` is only 200KB~, so you'd be pretty unlucky if you canceled ***right*** as the the actual `mv` operation was happening.

<details>
<summary>Where does monero-bash install itself?</summary>

---

The source folder gets installed in
```
/usr/local/share/monero-bash
```

The PATH is set with a symlink in
```
/usr/local/bin/monero-bash
```
The user folder is in
```
/home/user/.monero-bash
```

---
</details>

<details>
<summary>Where does monero-bash install packages?</summary>

---

```
/usr/local/share/monero-bash/bin/
```
is where packages live, with respective folder names

---
</details>

<details>
<summary>How to uninstall?</summary>

---
```
monero-bash uninstall
```
This will delete all `monero-bash` files AND `.monero-bash`

If your monero-bash is bugged and not uninstalling, you can manually remove everything like this:
```
sudo rm -r "/usr/local/share/monero-bash" &&
sudo rm "/usr/local/bin/monero-bash" &&
sudo rm -r "$HOME/.monero-bash"
```
Please be careful, remember to move your `/wallets/` before uninstalling!

## Todo
***To be added***
* Automatic P2Pool mining
* GPG key verification for binaries
* RPC/Daemon API integration
* Automatic encrypted wallet backups

*Added but not usable yet*
* XMRig, P2Pool can be installed but not invoked
* systemd intergrated, but not invokable
* `watch` command works, but no XMRig/P2Pool instance to watch
