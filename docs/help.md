```
if you ever move the `/monero-bash/` folder, execute `./monero-bash path` to re-add to PATH

currently, it gets added/removed to PATH via your `$USER/.bashrc` with `echo` and `sed`

an alternative would be to:
```
sudo ln -s monero-bash /usr/bin/monero-bash
```
this is a much cleaner (and safer) way of doing it, but it requires `sudo`, which i'd like to avoid


## Folder Structure
the /monero-bash/ folder (ignoring git and docs) starts like this:
```
monero-bash/
├─ monero-bash
├─ config
├─ src
```
after the initial configuration, monero-bash might look something like this:

```
monero-bash/            root folder
├─ monero-bash          main script itself
├─ config               config file for monero-bash
├─ cli                  where monero-cli binaries live
├─ src                  source code of monero-bash
├─ wallets              where wallets files live
├─ .bitmonero           monero blockchain/data folder
├─ .tmp
├─ .old
```
*note: you do not need the folders inside `/monero-bash/`, you can set the paths anywhere*

the `.tmp` folder is used when downloading/extracting monero-cli and monero-bash (it is deleted afterwards)

when upgrading, monero-bash (by default), moves any old `cli` or `monero-bash` files in a timestamped folder inside `.old` instead of deleting them (if you'd like to change that, see the next section)


## Configuration
if you already use custom options/flags for `monerod` or `monero-wallet-cli` and want monero-bash to use them as well, make a `monerod.conf` or `monero-wallet-cli.conf` file and put them in your `.bitmonero` folder. [refer to this official monero documentation to learn more](https://monerodocs.org/interacting/monero-config-file)

for `monero-bash` specific configuration, edit the file `/monero-bash/config`
```
